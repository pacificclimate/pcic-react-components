# PCIC React Components

An `npm`-installable package of PCIC-developed React components for use across 
projects.

Note: This README duplicates information in code comments, and may be out
of sync with them. It should be replaced by documentation generated from 
comments, but that is a future project.

## Installation

This package is not published to a Node package registry.
Instead, it is installed directly from GitHub, as follows:

Using SSH protocol (preferred):
```bash
npm install git+ssh://git@github.com/pacificclimate/pcic-react-components.git#<version>
```

Using HTTPS protocol:
```bash
npm install git+https://git@github.com/pacificclimate/pcic-react-components.git#<version>
```

From there, `pcic-react-components` is like any other installed package,
and components are imported in JS code the usual way:

```js
import { ExampleComponent } from 'pcic-react-components';
```

## Package contents

### Selector components

These components provide selectors specialized to the purposes of 
Climate Explorer, Plan2Adapt, and other apps.

#### Core selectors

Although these selectors were developed to support specific PCIC apps,
they are quite general and provide plug-in points (via props) so that they
can easily be specialized. Other selectors in this package are just such
specializations of these selectors.

These selectors wrap (render) [React Select v2](https://react-select.com/home).

All React Select v2 properties are passed through to the rendered 
React Select v2 selector, enabling the user to further customize each component 
using the tools provided by React Select v2. 
(As a tiny example, one can provide a value for
`placeholder`, which is rendered when no option is selected.)

All selectors are controlled components, and communicate values in and out
of the component in the standard way, using properties with the standard names
`value` and `onChange`.

##### `GroupingSelector`

Renders a React Select v2 selector whose options are constructed from 
a list of basis items. 

Options are constructed using a user-supplied function that maps each
basis item to an option value (an arbitrary JS object). The mapping is permitted
to map many basis items to a single (deep) equal value; indeed that is much of 
the point of this component. 

All basis items that map to the same value are grouped together and represented
by a single option. (Hence the name `GroupingSelector`.)

Component properties allow the user to provide functions to
* compute the option label (the string presented in the UI) 
* compute the enabled/disabled status of each option
* sort, group, and otherwise arrange options for presentation
* replace an invalid value (a value which does not correspond to any 
    enabled option) with a valid value
    
**Important**: This component communicates (via props `value`, `onChange`)
option values (the result of basis item mapping) only, not full options.
This differs from React Select v2, which communicates full options.
This may or may not be a wise choice.
  
For more details, see code comments documenting `GroupingSelector`.

##### `SimpleConstraintGroupingSelector`

Renders a `GroupingSelector`, injecting an enabled/disabled function
that enables an option if and only if the supplied constraint value 
(a JS object) matches one of the basis items that mapped to the option's value. 

This particular pattern is
used in most of the CE selectors (see below) and makes it particularly easy
to cascade selectors so that each successive selector in a sequence 
enables only those options that match the selections in preceding selectors.
See the MEV demonstration for an example of this usage.

For more details, see code comments documenting `SimpleConstraintGroupingSelector`.

#### Selectors specialized for Climate Explorer and related apps

These selectors wrap `SimpleConstraintGroupingSelector`.

These selectors handle as bases the Climate Explorer backend metadata 
(output of the `/multimeta` endpoint) as option bases (see `GroupingSelector`).

##### `ModelSelector`

Selector options are the (unique) models found in the input metadata.

Selector value is a string containing the `model_id` (from CE metadata).


##### `EmissionsScenarioSelector`

Selector options are the (unique) emissions scenarios found the input metadata.

Emissions scenarios are presented in more human-readable format 
(e.g., encoding "historical, rcp45" is presented as "Historical, then RCP 4.5").

Selector value is a string containing the `experiment` (from CE metadata).

##### `VariableSelector`

Selector options are the (unique) variables found the input metadata. 

Each option is characterized by a unique set of
values for the following subset of CE metadata values:

```js
{
  variable_id: String,
  variable_name: String,
  multi_year_mean: Boolean,
}
```

Note that distinct variables can have the same `variable_id` and `multi_year_mean`,
but differ on `variable_name`. This is arguably an incorrect way of naming variables,
but it's what we've got and this selector handles that. The distinction between
variables that differ only on `variable_name` is usually the period over which
they apply (e.g., monthly vs. annual), and so far only occurs for Climdex variables.

It can be similarly argued that a variable with 
`multi_year_mean === false` vs one with `multi_year_mean === true`
is actually a different variable (e.g., `pr` vs. `pr_mym`), but this is also
what we've got, hence this trio of values that encode the full identity of 
a variable.

Options are grouped by `multi_year_mean`. 
Each option bears an icon denoting the value of `multi_year_mean`.

Selector value is an object of the shape above.

##### `DataspecSelector`

Selector options are the (unique) "dataspecs" found the input metadata. 

Each option is characterized by a unique set of
values for the following subset of CE metadata values:

```js
{
  start_date: String,
  end_date: String,
  ensemble_member: String,
}
```

Unique values of `ensemble_member` (which are run codes such as "r1i1p1") 
are mapped to the more human-friendly form "Run 1", "Run 2", etc.

Selector value is an object of the shape above.

##### `TimePeriodSelector`

Selector options are the (unique) time periods found in the input metadata.

Each option is characterized by a unique set of
values for the following subset of CE metadata values:

```js
{
  start_date: String,
  end_date: String,
}
```

Selector value is an object of the shape above.


## Contributing and "publishing"

We put the term "publishing" in quotes because we don't publish to a
Node registry, we just push package contents to GitHub and `npm install`
the package directly from GitHub. (See Installation above.)

Important:

* Only content under the `src/lib` subtree 
  is included in the package that is built. 

* Content outside the `src/lib` subtree is excluded from the package,
  but is allowed and can be extremely useful; for example, to
  create demonstrations of package content (see `src/demo` subtree).

* Each item exported by the package must be exported in the file 
  `src/lib/index.js`.

### Publishing and releasing

When you modify this package (i.e., when you modify the contents of the 
`src/lib` subtree), follow this procedure:

1. Make sure you export any new or renamed components in `src/lib/index.js`.

1. When all modifications have been completed, commit the code.

1. On the command line, `npm run build`. 

   A successful build will output something like the following:

    ```text
    > pcic-react-components@0.1.0 build /home/rglover/code/pcic-react-components
    > rimraf dist && NODE_ENV=production babel src/lib --out-dir dist --copy-files --ignore __tests__,spec.js,test.js,__snapshots__
    
    Successfully compiled 17 files with Babel.
    ```

   A successful build on changed `src/lib` content will cause files in the `dist/` subtree to be modified. 

1. Commit the changes in `dist/`.

1. Increment `version` in `package.json`.

1. Summarize the changes from the last version in `NEWS.md`.

1. Commit these changes, then tag the release, and push all to GitHub, including tag:

   ```bash
   git add package.json NEWS.md
   git commit -m "Bump to version x.x.x"
   git tag -a -m "x.x.x" x.x.x
   git push --follow-tags
   ```

## Package development framework

### Create React App

This package is developed using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
as the basis. To do this takes a little effort, but is worth it for the
following reasons:

1. All the out-of-box language and dev support benefits of Create React App:

   * React, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support.

   * Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.

   * Autoprefixed CSS, so you donâ€™t need -webkit- or other prefixes.

   * A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.

   * A live development server that warns about common mistakes.

   * A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.

   * An offline-first service worker and a web app manifest, meeting all the Progressive Web App criteria. (Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher)

1. Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

1. Easy to create demonstration apps for the components under development.

1. Familiarity.

1. Exact correspondence to our production environment 
(not that free-standing React components can or should depend much on the 
dev vs. prod environments, but ...).

### Adapting a Create React App project to package development

A CRA project is not an npm package, alas. Some adjustment is required.
Fortunately it is not too onerous.

After [reviewing a variety of ways](https://pcic.uvic.ca/confluence/display/CSG/Creating+an+npm+package+of+React+components+using+create-react-app) 
to adapt a Create React App project to package development, 
we chose what appears to be the simplest, implemented through
[`create-component-lib`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-component-lib).

With a small amount of tweaking, this worked out.
