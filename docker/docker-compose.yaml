# This docker-compose uses the following shell environment variables:
#
# `SDP_PORT`: External port to map to
# `SDP_PUBLIC_URL`: Public URL of app
#
# Their values are set appropriately in the Makefile for use on a workstation.
# For use in a production setting, either set the shell
# variables appropriately when invoking docker-compose, or modify (a copy of)
# this file with the desired values.
